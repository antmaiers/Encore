Milestone 3 was a big step up for us after Milestone 2.

Our app has two primary roles: host or voter. Our homepage gives us the option to create an account if we have not yet made one. After creating an account, the user has the option to sign in as a "host" or "voter."

Beginning with the Host login: once logged in, a list of current events created by hosts appears. The host has the option to create a new event. After clicking "Create a New Event," the host is taken to a "Create Event" page and fills out the corresponding attributes. Once the host submits that event, the poll begins running and the host has the power to stop it at any time. Once the host stops the timer, he or she will receive the statistic results for each song from the voters. The host can then return to the event management page.


Now, logging in as a Voter: the Voter will be taken to a page with a list of current events and has the choice to select one. After selecting the preferred event, the voter now sees the list of song options that the host provided; the voter could select one and submit.


ISSUES: The Host event input can be saved to the firebase array, but we are continuing to work on accessing and displaying it. We are also still working on the voter being able to view this information that the host inputs. Also, once this information is accessible we will be able to conduct the voter statistics.
