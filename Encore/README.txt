Encore is a mobile app designed for fans attending concerts that allows users to vote for encore songs. 

There are two users for our mobile application: a Host and a Voter. A new user can create an account using a valid email address and password. The user can then login as a voter or a host.

When logged in as a host, the user sees a dashboard with a list of all the current events. If an event was created by the logged in user, they will see options to edit (Start, Stop, View Progress, Delete). The host can create an event at any time and they will be required to fill in the necessary details (Name, Time, Location, Song options, etc.). There is also a search bar feature that allows host to search events by name. 

Similarly, when logged in as a voter, the user will see a dashboard with all the current events. If an event is open, the user will see a button to vote; if an event is closed, the user will see a button to view results. If an event is brand new and has not been started yet, the user will not see any options.
